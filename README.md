This repository contains price calculator functionality for the new, designer-optimized brochure landing page.

The current framework uses a baseline brochure price (determined by market value analysis of our current default brochure configuration), applies press sheet and ink type adjustments, and adds cost-plus-markup operations prices to arrive at a final price. Since prices that are drastically different than those currently listed on SPDC would be disruptive, the model checks its output prices against legacy prices to ensure that they are "in the same ballpark" (and adjusts its outputs if necessary).

Moving forward, this model provides the flexibility to set prices for specific configurations independent of underlying productions costs or markups.
